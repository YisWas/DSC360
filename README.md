Student Code for DSC360 - Data Mining: Text Analytics and Unstructured Data

This repository is based on, and for use in conjunction with, the book *Text Analytics with Python: A Practitioner's Guide to Natural Language Processing 2nd Edition* by by Dipanjan Sarkar. You can get the book on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Text-Analytics-Python-Practitioners-Processing-ebook-dp-B07S5QNB6W/dp/B07S5QNB6W/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=.

My main purpose for this repository is to update Dipanjan's code to Python 3 (which doesn't seem to be happening in his GitHub repository) without messing with Dipanjan's repository. But my other purpose is, where applicable, to introduce other code into the mix (e.g., spaCy).

This repository was created for the Bellevue University DSC 360 Course.
